## ShowMe

### ðŸš€ Introduction
ShowMe is a full-stack web application designed to help users discover, track, and manage their favorite TV showsâ€”and soon, movies. The goal of the project is to create a personalized entertainment dashboard thatâ€™s fast, accessible, and easy to use. By combining clean UI design with robust backend functionality, ShowMe empowers users to explore content, save favorites, and monitor their viewing progressâ€”all in one place.
This project was built to deepen my experience in full-stack development, strengthen my understanding of API integration, and demonstrate how thoughtful engineering can solve real-world user needs.

### What this project does
- Lets anyone discover TV shows with a clean, fast UI.
- Fetches show data (via the backendâ€™s TVmaze proxy) and displays:
  - Paginated lists, cover images, premiere dates, ratings, and genres.
  - A show details modal with summary and star ratings.
- Provides search and genre filters to quickly find content.
- Enables authenticated users to:
  - Save shows to their account (favorites/watchlist).
  - Track progress (e.g., season/episode and related metadata).
  - Edit profile info (username, avatar).
- Uses semantic HTML, ARIA, and BEM-based CSS for accessibility and responsiveness.
